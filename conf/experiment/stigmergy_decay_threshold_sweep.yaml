defaults:
  - override /pheromones: grid # Select the grid pheromone model

# --- Fixed parameters for all runs in this sweep ---
seed: 2025 # Use a fixed seed for all runs in this sweep for comparability across swept params
num_ants: 64
mean_burst_speed: 7.0 # Example of fixing another param for the whole sweep

batch_run:
  max_simulation_time: 2000
  data_collection_interval: 10.0
  collect_pheromone_map: true # Let's collect maps for this grid sweep

# --- Parameters to be swept ---
# Define the values you want to sweep over.
# These are defined here for clarity and can be referenced by the sweeper.
# Note: These paths (e.g., pheromones.pheromone_decay_rate) must match
# how these parameters are structured in your final composed config (usually from config.yaml or pheromones/*.yaml).

# Option 1: Define sweep values directly here (less common for complex sweeps but simple)
# For example, if these parameters are defined at the top level of grid.yaml or config.yaml:
# swept_params_for_grid:
#   decay_rates: [0.90, 0.95, 0.99]
#   thresholds: [10.0, 15.0, 20.0]

# --- Hydra sweeper configuration ---
hydra:
  sweeper:
    # Default sweeper is 'basic', which creates a Cartesian product of swept parameters.
    # Other sweepers like 'ax' or 'optuna' can be installed for more advanced hyperparameter optimization.
    params:
      # Syntax: path.to.parameter.in.composed.config: "comma-separated,values" or Python list-like string
      # These parameters will be varied across multiple runs.
      
      # Assuming 'pheromone_decay_rate' and 'pheromone_threshold' are under the 'pheromones' group
      # which is defined in conf/pheromones/grid.yaml
      pheromones.pheromone_decay_rate: 0.90,0.95,0.99
      pheromones.pheromone_threshold: 10.0,15.0,20.0
      
      # Example: If you also wanted to sweep a top-level parameter like 'mean_rest_duration'
      # (assuming it's in config.yaml at the top level)
      # mean_rest_duration: 2.0,3.0,4.0
      
      # Example: If you wanted to sweep grid_radius_cells (assuming it's in grid.yaml under 'pheromones')
      # pheromones.grid_radius_cells: 2,3,4
