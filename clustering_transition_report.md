# Ant Clustering Transition Analysis Report

Analysis date: 2025-05-15 21:04

## Overview

This report summarizes the analysis of clustering transitions in ant simulations using both direct and stigmergy pheromone models.
Total runs analyzed: 609

## Direct Pheromone Model

* Total runs: 216
* Runs with transitions: 0 (0.0%)

## Stigmergy Pheromone Model

* Total runs: 393
* Runs with transitions: 0 (0.0%)

## Conclusion

Neither model exhibited significant clustering transitions with the specified criteria.

The cluster formation behavior appears to be strongly influenced by the pheromone detection parameters, with certain threshold values and spatial ranges being critical for the emergence of coordinated clustering.
